The trackball demo example in the code shows that outside the trackball, the model rotates about its OWN z-axis, not the view's. However the assignment asks for a rotation about the view's z-axis. Thus, I assumed that's what was correct. To this end, you will find that if you translate the model away from the view's z-axis, and then perform a trackball rotation outside the trackball's bounds, the model will "orbit" (rotate around) the view's z-axis.

I used Blender to create my model. Every mesh is mine except the head/face. For that, I used this mesh: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/nextgen-head-3d-obj/525420

I read up on trackball rotations from https://www.xarg.org/2021/07/trackball-rotation-using-quaternions/

The model I used is (a horribly simplified) "Lamassu". I'm of Iraqi origin and I wanted to portray this creature known widely from Assyrian mythology <3 Enjoy! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamassu

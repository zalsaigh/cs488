# Compilation

I used std=c++17 instead of 14. Program should be run from the A4 directory. Nothing else was changed. I tested my assignment on the VirtualBox VM.


# Manual

I've previously done Peter Shirley's Raytracing in One Weekend guide, so I've taken some of my old code from my personal repository that holds my 
implementation of that project (https://github.com/zalsaigh/raytracer).

Reference: [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

Also used lots of the supplemental documents provided by Prof Baranoski - specifically RT_Kernel.pdf, Background_Optics.pdf, so on...
